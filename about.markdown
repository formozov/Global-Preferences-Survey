This study reproduces the results of the article [Relationship of gender differences in preferences to economic development and gender equality](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6412/eaas9899.full) (DOI: 10.1126/science.aas9899) and partially its [supplementary material](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/10/17/362.6412.eaas9899.DC1/aas9899_Falk_SM.pdf).

The following two relevant papers have to be also cited in all publications that make use of or refer in any kind to GPS dataset:

- Falk, A., Becker, A., Dohmen, T., Enke, B., Huffman, D., & Sunde, U. (2018). [Global evidence on economic preferences.](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy013) *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 133 (4), 1645â€“1692.

Below we describe how we collected, clean and standardized the data, as well the the whole analysis pipeline. The output files allow the reader to reproduce the figures directly, bypassing the pipeline. For more details, especially on the background study and the meaning of the variables, refer to the main paper.
